# Lunar LITE
Lunar LITE is a very slightly edited version of [Lunar](https://github.com/zeyad-mansour/lunar).

Lunar LITE offers a triggerbot and updated packages for the orignal [Lunar](https://github.com/zeyad-mansour/lunar).

## Lunar V2
Lunar V2 on the other hand, has 25+ customizable settings, UI, improved accuracy, and support for YoloV5, YoloV7, & YoloV8.

Lunar V2 can be found [here](https://gannonr.com/downloads).

## About

Lunar can be modified to work with a variety of FPS games; however, it is currently configured for Fortnite. Besides being general purpose, the main advantage of using Lunar is that it does not meddle with the memory of other processes.

Lunar LITE uses [YOLOv5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5)
